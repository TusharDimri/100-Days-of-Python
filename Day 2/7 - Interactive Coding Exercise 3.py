I was reading this article by Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks and realised just how little time we actually have.

[https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html)

Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old. 

It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

> You have x days, y weeks, and z months left. 

Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers. 

# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
age = input("What is your current age?")
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡

"""

age = int(input("What is your current age?"))

print(f"You have {(90-age)*365} days, {(90-age)*52} weeks and {(90-age)*12} months left")
