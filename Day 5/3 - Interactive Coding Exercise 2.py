Highest Score

Instructions:-
You are going to write a program that calculates the highest score from a List of scores. 

e.g. `student_scores = [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]`

**Important** you are not allowed to use the max or min functions. The output words must match the example. i.e 

> `The highest score in the class is: x`

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
student_scores = input("Input a list of student scores ").split()
for n in range(0, len(student_scores)):
  student_scores[n] = int(student_scores[n])
print(student_scores)
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

#Write your code below this row 👇


"""
student_scores = input("Input a list of student scores ").split()
# for n in range(0, len(student_scores)):
#   student_scores[n] = int(student_scores[n])

student_scores = list(map(lambda x:int(x), student_scores))
print(student_scores)

max = student_scores[0]
for n in range(1, len(student_scores)):
    if student_scores[n] > max:
        max = student_scores[n]

print(f"The highest score in the class is: {max}")
