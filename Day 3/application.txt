Respected Sir

Subject: To Remove Industrial Integration from my stream

Respected Sir/Madam

This is to bring into your notice, that my name is Tushar Dimri. I am a B.Tech second year student, from Section C in our esteemed university.

I had opted for BACHELOR OF TECHNOLOGY / CST WITH ML & AI in the beginning of the session I want to state that I want to change my stream to BTech. CSE (without Industrial Integration).

The specilization subjects were to be taught from 3rd smester onwards. I now have changed my mind and want to focus on core subjects only and hence I want to remove the specialization form my course.

I request you to please change my stream at the earliest.

Yours Sincerely 
Tushar Dimri
