# Fix the code below:- 

# number = int(input("Which number do you want to check?"))

# if number % 2 = 0:
#   print("This is an even number.")
# else:
#   print("This is an odd number.")

number = int(input("Which number do you want to check?"))

if number % 2 ==  0: # Here we had = in place of ==. We had a red line marking the error which heklped me fix it.
  print("This is an even number.")
